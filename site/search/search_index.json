Installation is straightforward, please follow the default prompts and apply those settings. During the installation, the installer will ask to set the password for the \u2018postgres\u2019 user account. This account is required for starting and stopping the postgresql database service. Set the password to the following: PasswordPassword123 The client application uses this password by default. The \u2018postgres\u2019 user account serves no other purpose and requires no administrative privileges. Warning At the end of the installation, the installer asks to install StackBuilder . We do NOT use StackBuilder for UAS and it is therefore, not necessary to install. PostgreSQL Service Configuration \u00b6 The following information is required to ensure a successful connection between the client/server applications: IP address of the server - this is necessary for the client PCs to access the server IP ranges for the client PCs - any valid ip range for the clients PCs that will be connecting to the database. This can be multiple address ranges. Allow Client PC Access \u00b6 To allow a UAS client application to connect to the database you MUST** edit the ** pg_hba.conf configurtation file and add all the client IP ranges collected in Step 2 above. This file is located here : C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\13\\data Edit the section at the bottom of the file that looks like this: # TYPE DATABASE USER ADDRESS METHOD # \"local\" is for Unix domain socket connections only local all all scram - sha - 256 # IPv4 local connections : host all all 127 . 0 . 0 . 1 / 32 scram - sha - 256 # IPv6 local connections : host all all :: 1 / 128 scram - sha - 256 # Allow replication connections from localhost , by a user with the # replication privilege . local replication all scram - sha - 256 host replication all 127 . 0 . 0 . 1 / 32 scram - sha - 256 host replication all :: 1 / 128 scram - sha - 256 host all all 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 / 0 scram - sha - 256 IPv4 local connections \u00b6 This section of the config file is where the client ranges are added. You can add clients indivually or as ranges: For an individual PC: # IPv4 local connections: host all all 127.0.0.1/32 scram-sha-256 host all all 10.10.12.26 trust For a range of IP addresses # IPv4 local connections: host all all 127.0.0.1/32 scram-sha-256 host all all 10.10.12.0/24 trust Info More detailed documentation can be found here at the PostgreSQL 8.4 Documentation Site Database Service Configuration \u00b6 The postgresql.conf controls setting for the database service. The file can be found here: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\PostgreSQL\\13\\data Make sure these setting changes have been made: listen_addresses = to \u2018*\u2019 port = 5432 Those are the minimal changes required to make the service run. Error Logging \u00b6 If you are having issues with the client PC's connecting, turn on the postgres service Error Logging . By default this is set to minimal to prevent it from filling up hard drive space unnecessarily. Edit the postgresql.conf file and find the section titled \u2018ERROR REPORTING AND LOGGING\u2019 . Set the values to those listed below: #------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # ERROR REPORTING AND LOGGING #------------------------------------------------------------------------------ . . . log_destination = stderr logging_collector = on log_directory = pg_log client_min_messages = debug3 log_connections = on log_dsconnections = on log_hostname = on Info For a more detailed explanation of the Error Log settings, please refere to the Postgres Documentaion - Errpr Reporting and Logging All log data is stored in the \u2018pg_log\u2019 folder with one file per day. Open the file in notepad to view any connection errors all of these can be turned off once the clients are setup Client Software Installation \u00b6 Run the installation program on the USB disk provided or download the software here: http://ftp.sdt.be/pub/Software/Ultranalysis%20Suite%203/BaseSetup/LatestVersion/UAS%203%20Base%20Setup%20-%20Extractor.exe Choose the second option to connect to a remote database: The client program is installed in two parts: Install the necessary support libraries to run Ultranalysis Suite: .NET framework and Crystal Reports engine Install the Ultranalysis Suite Software Accept Defaults Follow the prompts, there are no setting required at this stage. License Client PC's \u00b6 Once the installation is complete, you must launch Ultranalysis Suite to license the software. The license screen will appear until it has been properly configured. The software can only run in Demo mode without a proper license and will have liimited functionality. Ultranalysis Suite is licensed per PC and uses a combination of the serial number and various hardware id's on the client PC to generate a license code. Each end user will be emailed a serial number and instructions on how to obtain a license number. Enter the Serial Number and click on \u2018Generate\u2019 to create a Hardware PC Code. To obtain a license number go to this webpage: https://www.sdt.be/extranet/licenses/activate You will need the Serial Number and Hardware PC Code to continue. Once you have the license number return to the Ultranaly Suite software to enter all three numbers and your name and company name: Set Database Connection \u00b6 Once you have successfully licensed the software you will be prompted to create a database connection: Click the checkbox for the 'Advanced Settings' and change the 'Host' from 'localhost' to the IP address of the postgres database server. If you changed the password for the postgres user account on the server you will need to change the password here, otherwise leave the settings as they are and click 'Apply'. You should receive a message that the database connection was created successfully, if you do not, go back through your settings and make sure all IP addresses are correct and that you have added the client IP ranges to the configuration files on the server.
