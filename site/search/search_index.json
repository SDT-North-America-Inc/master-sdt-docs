Installation is straightforward, please follow the default prompts and apply those settings. During the installation, the installer will ask to set the password for the \u2018postgres\u2019 user account. This account is required for starting and stopping the postgresql database service. Set the password to the following: PasswordPassword123 The client application uses this password by default. The \u2018postgres\u2019 user account serves no other purpose and requires no administrative privileges. Warning At the end of the installation, the installer asks to install StackBuilder . We do NOT use StackBuilder for UAS and it is therefore, not necessary to install. PostgreSQL Service Configuration \u00b6 The following information is required to ensure a successful connection between the client/server applications: IP address of the server - this is necessary for the client PCs to access the server IP ranges for the client PCs - any valid ip range for the clients PCs that will be connecting to the database. This can be multiple address ranges. Allow Client PC Access \u00b6 To allow a UAS client application to connect to the database you MUST** edit the ** pg_hba.conf configurtation file and add all the client IP ranges collected in Step 2 above. This file is located here : C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\13\\data Edit the section at the bottom of the file that looks like this: # TYPE DATABASE USER ADDRESS METHOD # \"local\" is for Unix domain socket connections only local all all scram - sha - 256 # IPv4 local connections : host all all 127 . 0 . 0 . 1 / 32 scram - sha - 256 # IPv6 local connections : host all all :: 1 / 128 scram - sha - 256 # Allow replication connections from localhost , by a user with the # replication privilege . local replication all scram - sha - 256 host replication all 127 . 0 . 0 . 1 / 32 scram - sha - 256 host replication all :: 1 / 128 scram - sha - 256 host all all 0 . 0 . 0 . 0 / 0 scram - sha - 256 IPv4 local connections \u00b6 This section of the config file is where the client ranges are added.

License Client PC's \u00b6 Once the installation is complete, you must launch Ultranalysis Suite to license the software. The license screen will appear until it has been properly configured. The software can only run in Demo mode without a proper license and will have liimited functionality. Ultranalysis Suite is licensed per PC and uses a combination of the serial number and various hardware id's on the client PC to generate a license code. Each end user will be emailed a serial number and instructions on how to obtain a license number. Enter the Serial Number and click on \u2018Generate\u2019 to create a Hardware PC Code. To obtain a license number go to this webpage: https://www.sdt.be/extranet/licenses/activate You will need the Serial Number and Hardware PC Code to continue. Once you have the license number return to the Ultranaly Suite software to enter all three numbers and your name and company name: Set Database Connection \u00b6 Once you have successfully licensed the software you will be prompted to create a database connection: Click the checkbox for the 'Advanced Settings' and change the 'Host' from 'localhost' to the IP address of the postgres database server. If you changed the password for the postgres user account on the server you will need to change the password here, otherwise leave the settings as they are and click 'Apply'.

Creating and Editing Tree Structure \u00b6 As mentioned before, building a tree structure is like laying a foundation: If done correctly, all further actions will be much easier. Decide about Tree Structure logic and take following in consideration: What assets are connected by process? What assets are connected by location? What assets belong to same type, or same manufacturer? What assets are redundancy? There are many criteria, but target is always the same: Your data needs to be organized in a way that reflects reality. Tree structure needs to offer easy overview, filtering, and conclusion to one who uses it, as well as clean and straightforward work order/survey for one collecting data/inspecting. Take good care about names: lower case, upper case, space ... makes a difference. Nomenclature needs to be decided, and whatever the decision is, all involved need to follow it. Otherwise, database will be useless, source of many frustrations and it will consume a lot of your time and time of those who need to collect data. Apart of proper creation of Tree Structure, each measurement point needs strictly defined measurement settings. 10.1. Adding Nodes \u00b6 Note! All functions explained here, done directly in the Tree Structure with right and left click, can also be executed from Top toolbar, selecting Tree Nodes, as shown below: Right click on the Database Name or on an existing Node. On the drop-down menu select Add New and then select Asset. Add Node Name (up to 30 characters). You can add Node Icon and Navigation Picture to your asset, as shown below. Now there is a first level in your Tree Structure . At this point, we can add Asset, Measurement Point or Measurement Settings to already added Asset 1 . Let us add another Asset , in this case an electrical motor. Right click on Asset 1, Add New, and select Asset. Same as in previous step, you can add Node Icon and Navigation Picture. At this stage, we added Asset, then we added an electrical motor that is part of that Asset . Now, let us add **Measurement Point , a bearing. Right click on motor, Add New , and select * Measurement Point . * As you can see, we did not use all available levels, as we did not need them. At this stage, we arrived at Measurement Point. Next (and only) thing we can do, and need to do, on Measurement Point is Measurement Settings . But first, let us Edit a Node . 10.2. Editing Nodes \u00b6 In case you need to edit any of data you added to node, right click on Node you want to edit and select Edit . As we previously added Asset 1 , we will change it now in Fan 1 . 10.3. Adding a Measurement Settings \u00b6 Following Tree Structure architecture and naming importance, Measurement Settings are critically important and often partially determine the quality and usefulness of collected data. Measurement Settings contain information about type of the sensor used, interval of data collection, acquisition time. In some cases, also filter frequency, sampling rate, emissivity. In case of Lubrication, Measurement Settings contain even more information. Let us see case by case. Note that Measurement Settings can be added only to Measurement Point and cannot exist in same parent node at the same level as Asset or Measurement Point . 10.3.1. Measurement Settings for SDT340 \u00b6 In case of previously added Motor NdE bearing in Fan 1 , we would like to define several different measurements that need to be collected regularly. Create Measurement Settings window that pops up will look like this: First, choose a sensor. In Sensor Name window, press arrow for drop down menu. Only sensors you selected in System Settings will be displayed. Select needed sensor and continue with settings. In this case, we will choose Ultrasound sensor . Next, we need to select Sample Rate . Left click on Sample Rate window arrow for drop down menu and select needed Sample Rate . You can choose between 32.000, 128.000, and 256.000 samples per second for contact sensors while Sampling rate for airborne sensors is fixed at 32.000 samples per second. Filter Frequency Setting for Ultrasound sensors is fixed at displayed frequency band. Category Name is non-editable field. Interval defines how often data needs to be collected, and it is a mandatory field. It will help you organize your surveys/work orders better by being able what tasks need to be done in coming period. Interval definition is product of your understanding of the asset and needs to come from your Criticality Analysis, Failure Mode & Effect Analysis, DIPF Curve for certain asset and certain defects, sometimes even from Failure Rate and Root Cause Analysis. Interval too long can result in anomaly development not being detected at early stage, and interval too short will have a detrimental effect of your work optimization, spending your resources unnecessarily (in this case, manpower). Interval in UAS3 Measurement Settings can be defined in Hours, Days, Weeks , and Months . Left click on time unit window, select unit, and enter the value in Interval window. Finally, you need to define Acquisition Time . Acquisition time is duration of a single measurement, recorded reading. Acquisition Time needs to be decided based on asset operation conditions. Primary factor affecting acquisition time is rotating speed (in case of rotating assets) or process itself. In case of bearings, we would like to record at least 3-5 revolutions, preferably 5-7 revolutions. As not all Assets inspected by Ultrasound are rotating, consider process itself. Take hydraulic valve as example and consider that you need to wait for its operation as well as record the operation itself. Not that in SDT340 maximum Acquisition Time depends on Sample Rate. 32.000 samples per second - maximum Acquisition Time is 600 seconds (10 minutes) 128.000 samples per second - maximum Acquisition Time is 150 seconds (2 minutes and 30s) 256.000 samples per second - maximum Acquisition Time is 75 seconds (1 minute and 15s) In case we choose Vibration sensor, Accelerometer , some details will be different. Choose the sensor, in this case Acc100 . Next, we need to select Sample Rate . Left click on Sample Rate window arrow for drop down menu and select needed Sample Rate . You can choose between 32.000 and 64.000 samples per second. Filter Frequency Setting for Vibration sensor can be adjusted int three ranges: 5 \u2013 1000 Hz 10 \u2013 1000 Hz 10 \u2013 10000 Hz Category Name will reflect your Frequency range settings, therefore considering different Frequency range practically as a different sensor, displaying it separately in Measurement Point . Interval defines how often data needs to be collected, and it is a mandatory field. It will help you organize your surveys/work orders better by being able what tasks need to be done in coming period. Interval definition is product of your understanding of the asset and needs to come from your Criticality Analysis, Failure Mode & Effect Analysis, DIPF Curve for certain asset and certain defects, sometimes even from Failure Rate and Root Cause Analysis. Interval too long can result in anomaly development not being detected at early stage, and interval too short will have a detrimental effect of your work optimization, spending your resources unnecessarily (in this case, manpower). Interval in UAS3 Measurement Settings can be defined in Hours, Days, Weeks , and Months . Left click on time unit window, select unit, and enter the value in Interval window. Finally, you need to define Acquisition Time . Acquisition time is duration of a single measurement, recorded reading. Acquisition Time needs to be decided based on asset operation conditions. Not that in SDT340 maximum Acquisition Time depends on Sample Rate. 32.000 samples per second - maximum Acquisition Time is 600 seconds (10 minutes) 64.000 samples per second - maximum Acquisition Time is 150 seconds (2 minutes and 30s) If Temperature Sensor is selected, Interval and Emissivity need to be defined. Considering Interval , all mentioned before applies. Of course, Interval for all different measurements taken on one Asset should be the same, for practical reason. If they differ as outcome of analysis, shortest Interval should be the choice. In regard to Emissivity , you can look up in publicly available material about Emissivity for each surface material or look up for procedure to measure it yourself. However, for comparison and trending purposes, leaving Emissivity at value 1 would not be a mistake, but consider that temperature value in your reading is not exact. You can also add RPM sensor, in case of you only need to define Interval. To execute the measurement, you will need to place reflective tape, so please refer to SDT340 manual. Now, when we added as many Measurement Settings in our Measurement Point as we need, it will look like this: Small folder icon next to your sensor level means that it does not contain any data yet. 10.3.2. Measurement Settings for SDT270 \u00b6 When building Tree Structure for SDT270 and LUBExpert, there is a small difference; instead of Asset, Measurement Point and Measurement Settings, you will see Tree Node and Measurement Settings. In case of previously added Motor NdE bearing in Fan 1 , we would like to define several different measurements that need to be collected regularly. Create Measurement Settings window that pops up will look like this: First, choose a sensor. In Sensor Name window, press arrow for drop down menu. Only sensors you selected in System Settings will be displayed. Select needed sensor and continue with settings. In this case, we will choose Ultrasound sensor . Sample Rate in SDT270 is fixed for all sensors, so you will not be setting it as a measurement parameter. However, there is additional settings that needs to be done in SDT270 and LUBExpert that is not needed in SDT340. Setting Dynamic or/and Static measurement mode. When using SDT270 with Dynamic measurement feature, you need both Dynamic and Static settings in your Measurement Point (Tree Node). In case Static point is not defined it will be auto created with first measurement (if measurement is performed in Survey Mode, through Work Order). Measurement Name will be generated, containing Sensor name, Measurement Mode (ST or DY, Static or Dynamic) and it will contain Ht or Rw (Heterodyned for Ultrasound and Raw for Vibration). Interval defines how often data needs to be collected, and it is a mandatory field. It will help you organize your surveys/work orders better by being able what tasks need to be done in coming period. Interval definition is product of your understanding of the asset and needs to come from your Criticality Analysis, Failure Mode & Effect Analysis, DIPF Curve for certain asset and certain defects, sometimes even from Failure Rate and Root Cause Analysis. Interval too long can result in anomaly development not being detected at early stage, and interval too short will have a detrimental effect of your work optimization, spending your resources unnecessarily (in this case, manpower). Interval in UAS3 Measurement Settings can be defined in Hours, Days, Weeks, and Months . Left click on time unit window, select unit, and enter the value in Interval window. Finally, you need to define Acquisition Time . Acquisition time is duration of a single measurement, recorded reading. Acquisition Time needs to be decided based on asset operation conditions. Primary factor affecting acquisition time is rotating speed (in case of rotating assets) or process itself. In case of bearings, we would like to record at least 3-5 revolutions, preferably 5-7 revolutions. As not all Assets inspected by Ultrasound are rotating, consider process itself. Take hydraulic valve as example and consider that you need to wait for its operation as well as record the operation itself. Note that in SDT340 maximum Acquisition Time for SDT270 is 80 seconds. Now, if you prepared setting for Dynamic readings, add new settings with all equal parameters except Measurement Mode \u2013 choose Static. Or vice-versa. Your settings will look like this: In case we choose Vibration sensor, Accelerometer, some details will be different. Choose the sensor, in this case Acc1 . Sample Rate in SDT270 is fixed, so there will be no settings displayed. Filter Frequency Setting for Vibration sensor in SDT270 can be adjusted in two ranges: 10 \u2013 1000 Hz 10 \u2013 10000 Hz Once Dynamic or Static mode is selected (same approach as with Ultrasonic sensors), Measurement Name will reflect your Frequency range settings, therefore considering different Frequency range practically as a different sensor, displaying it separately in Measurement Point . Interval and Acquisition Time are set equally as in Ultrasonic sensor. If Temperature Sensor is selected, Interval and Emissivity need to be defined. Considering Interval , all mentioned before applies. Of course, Interval for all different measurements taken on one Asset should be the same, for practical reason. If they differ as outcome of analysis, shortest Interval should be the choice. In regard to Emissivity , you can look up in publicly available material about Emissivity for each surface material or look up for procedure to measure it yourself. However, for comparison and trending purposes, leaving Emissivity at value 1 would not be a mistake, but consider that temperature value in your reading is not exact. You can also add RPM sensor, in case of you only need to define Interval. To execute the measurement, you will need to place reflective tape, so please refer to SDT340 manual. Now, when we added as many Measurement Settings in our Measurement Point as we need, it will look like this: Small folder icon next to your sensor level means that it does not contain any data yet. 10.3.3. Measurement Settings for LUBExpert \u00b6 Assigning LUBExpert Sensors If you followed the instructions to go into LUBExpert Mode, the list of available sensors should only be two (LUBEsense and TEMP2). The other sensors are still visible but inactive. Choose LUBEsense to create an ultrasound measurement node and TEMP2 to create a temperature measurement node as required. For ultrasound measurements, UAS2 gives you the option to choose either Static or Dynamic and for temperature measurements you can set the measurement interval and the emissivity. The LUBExpert instrument in standard version does not measure Dynamic data, but LUBExpert Dynamic does. In case you operate with LUBExpert standard, choose Static measurement settings, otherwise your instrument will not recognize Dynamic settings. LUBExpert Dynamic will accept Dynamic measurement settings and collect Dynamic data during grease replenishment process. Same happens if you are using an SDT270DU with the LUBExpert App installed, choosing Dynamic here will instruct your SDT270DU to collect both Dynamic and Static data simultaneously. Setting the interval of data collection For both LUBEsense and TEMP2 measurements, the choice to set your preferred data collection interval time \u2776 in months, weeks, days, or hours \u2777 is made here. Note that this field is not intended to be the re-greasing interval. This field is your data collection interval. Condition assessment based on measured ultrasound data will be the trigger to perform grease replenishment (or not) as well as the quantity of grease required to restore an optimal lubrication mechanism to the bearing. For TEMP2 measurements the additional choice to set emissivity exists here. The default emissivity is 1.0. Setting Grease Type Earlier we described how to set up a list of all the lubricant types used in your plant under \u201cLubricant Management\u201d. With the \u201cCreate New Measurement\u201d dialogue box open, here you select the grease type for this bearing using the drop-down box beside the field Grease Name \u2778. Setting Grease Gun Earlier we described how to manage your inventory of grease guns under \u201cGrease Gun Management\u201d. In that section, you named your grease gun and entered its grease injection quantity per stroke. Now, as you create measurement collection points in UAS 3 , it is important to assign the correct grease gun to the correct asset. Click on the drop-down box and scroll to the grease gun name to be used. Hover and release your mouse to select \u2779 \u2779 \u00b6 \u2776 \u2777^ \u00b6 \u2778 \u00b6 Assigning bearing data to Lube point UAS 3 manages a bearing database. This puts bearing dimensions conveniently at your fingertips. In the field Bearing \u277a, you must assign bearing data to the lube point, so all the necessary and automatic settings are then filled by UAS3. In field \u277a, choose the drop-down menu where you will see all the bearing types currently available within the UAS3 bearing database. Alternatively, you can click \u201cEDIT\u201d and add new bearing types. Assigning bearing types already in the database Select the drop-down menu in field \u277a, browse the database and select the desired bearing. \u277a \u00b6 \u277b \u00b6 \u277c \u00b6 Adding new or editing existing bearings to the database Select \u201cEDIT\u201d in field \u277a and create new bearing, edit or delete existing bearing types. In case you do not know the type of the bearing installed, create a new one with a temporary name and approximate size and input accurate data at the first possible opportunity. Manual input of grease quantity If you want to manually add calculated grease quantity, chose \u201cEdit\u201d in field \u277c and enter the quantity. In this case, all pre-calculations will be done based on your input. Manually edited quantity will be shown in Italic. If you want to go back to automatically calculated qty, simply press the \u201cgo back\u201d arrow in field \u277c. Note that the bearing must be selected, at least temporary one, with an approximate size. Editing quantity by more than 30% might cause guidance malfunction. Side or Annular replenishment In field \u277b, you need to choose if grease replenishment is side or annular. Select \u201cside\u201d or \u201cannular\u201d from the drop-down menu. Note! If you chose to edit calculated grease quantity manually, this field will be blocked. \u277a Once you have selected a bearing that is actually installed in the asset as well as its replenishment position, OD, ID and Width are defined, and grease quantity is calculated and adjusted according to selected grease pump output. This quantity is used as a safety point only in case of \u201cSuspected Bearing Failure\u201d status and to provide automatic recommendation to \u201cShorten Interval\u201d that you have selected. Based on asset data selected at this point, UAS3 is also able to calculate steps in your guided lubrication process. In this example, step one will be 5 shots injection, step two 3 shots, step 3 and all following steps 2 shots. Setting rotational speed In order to complete the setup, UAS3 also needs information about the rotating speed of the selected asset. Enter the rotational speed in RPM in field \u277d. In case you are not sure about the rotating speed, or it is variable, set the lowest expected rotating speed to be on the safe side. Acquisition time Based on rotating speed, UAS3 will automatically calculate minimum and recommended acquisition time \u277e Recommended time is the result of positive experiences, but if desired, you can choose minimum time or any other acquisition time, but not less than minimum time and not greater than 80 seconds. Stabilization time Based on previously inserted data, UAS3 now automatically calculates the stabilization time and displays it in field \u277f Press \u201cSAVE\u201d and all settings for the selected asset are ready. These settings are assigned to the selected asset and go with it when workorders are transferred to the LUBExpert instrument. No further settings need to be done (nor can be done) in LUBExpert once in the field. This enables your grease technician to have comfortable, fast, and safe work in the field, as well as tight work control and dependable data for the Lubrication Manager. 10.4. Adding an Event \u00b6 Event is additional textual information assigned to asset. It contains certain message (what) and date (when). Events can be added in UAS3 and in instrument itself (as automatic or manually added messages). Adding events has a great value for better understanding of data and for easier use of database. They represent certain observations or comment, some action that is important to be \u277d \u00b6 \u277e \u00b6 \u277f \u00b6 logged, represent Lubrication decision flow, but are also highly valuable as flags in time making your searches or analytics easier. Event can be assigned to Asset, Measurement Point (SDT340), and Tree Node (SDT270 & LUBExpert). Even can not be added at sensor level. Right click on Tree Node , choose Add New and click on Event . Event window will pop up: Enter Description of Event and click on Save . Even is added and it will be displayed in Static Trend and Bottom Pane , and it can be use in data filtering. Manually added events in UAS3, or manually added messages in instrument (both treated as events) are marked with (M) . Automatically added messages in instrument (LUBExpert) are equally treated as events and marked with (A) . 10.5. Copying and Pasting Nodes \u00b6 Once engaged in building a database, you will often face similar equipment, similar configurations, sometimes practically identical groups, or processes. Obviously, there will be lots of copy/paste at certain point. You can cut, copy and paste Measurement Settings (Sensor level), Asset Component, Asset or entire group (branch). Look at situation below: In our Database Root, Example Plant, we created a Fan Group. Within Fan Group we have Fan 1 containing motor and fan. Both motor and fan contain one Measurement Point each, with detailed Measurement Settings. But in reality, we have several fans in this Fan Group, both motor and fan have two bearings, of course, and throughout the plant, we have several Fan Groups like this one. Let us start with completing motor and fan. Right click on NdE bearing (or use Top toolbar commands), move one level up (parent node, motor) and paste it. Note that there are two tools: Copy Structure Only \u2013 Structure will be copied with all settings, but measurement data will not be copied, very useful when building Tree Structure or expanding it. Copy \u2013 Entire point will be copied, including measurement data. Very useful when component or Asset are moved to a different location, or when partial backup needs to be done. Select one level up (parent node, motor) and click on Paste. NdE bearing is now pasted in Node motor, with name NdE bearing (1). Now right click on newly pasted NdE bearing (1) and select Edit and rename it to DE bearing Now we have completed motor and fan, but we might want to copy/paste entire Fan 1, as we have more than one Fan in Fan Group . Process is same. Right click on Fan 1, select Copy Structure Only (if we don\u2019t want to copy measurement data as well), right click on Fan Group (parent node) and select Paste. Edit the name (example Fan 2). Note! Sensor Level (Measurement) cannot be pasted into the Node that already contains same Measurement Name or Category Name . Sensor Level (Measurement) cannot be pasted into the Node that contains other nodes, it can only be pasted into Measurement Point level. If you need to copy/paste certain nodes into another Tree Structure, process is same as shown here for copy/paste within same Tree Structure. Copy Node you need, open another Tree Structure and Paste it. 10.6. Drag and drop Data \u00b6 Measurement Settings (Sensor Level) can be copied from Bottom Pane into the Tree Structure. To select the data you want to move, press, and hold on the left button of your mouse. Use Shift and Ctrl to select multiple data. Drag the data to the desired Location on the Top Pane. Hoover your mouse over desired location in the Tree Structure, and it will open child nodes down to the measurement level where you can paste. Drop the data by releasing the left button of the mouse. Equally, you can drag and drop data within the Tree Structure. 10.7. Insert a Static Data \u00b6 UAS3 allows you to insert static data manually. Right click on a Static Measurement. On the drop- down menu, select Add New/Reading Data . The following window is displayed: The field Sensor Name is filled automatically by UAS3. Choose the date of the Data by clicking the drop-down menu Time Stamp . Please fill the field RMS (for US sensors and accelerometers), or Value (for the other sensors) with a numerical value. This field is mandatory while the following are optional. Click Save to finish the operation. 10.8. Import Dynamic Data or Wave file \u00b6 You can import a wave file into UAS3, and you will be able to analyze the time signal and eventually the spectrum. However, it is possible that values (amplitudes) will not be accurate since not all data (amplification for instance) will not be available. To import Dynamic Data, right click on a Dynamic Measurement. On the drop-down menu, select Add New/Reading Data . The following window is displayed: Click the browse button , placed under the field Signal Source and then select the name of the wave file and its location. Click Save to finish the operation. 10.9. Working with Work Orders/ Surveys \u00b6 Work Order/Survey is an organized task extracted from Tree Structure . It contains selected Assets and Measurement Points in pre-defined order, all Measurement Settings and Alarms , allowing field operator to execute data collection in clear, fast and an efficient manner. Clear, fast, and efficient also results in Safe , by minimizing field work. Executing task through Work Order/Survey assures that data is collected using same settings, thus being comparable for further analysis. Work Order/Survey is created by selecting and adding items from your Tree Structure . One item can be in several Work Order/Survey . Work Order/Survey does not affect Tree Structure . You can create as many Work Order/Survey as you need, no limitations. Work Order/Survey can contain items from one Tree Structure only. Work Order/Survey must be designed with practicality of field work in mind. Way the Assets are organized in Tree Structure should reflect needs of person using UAS3, to be able to overview Data in most efficient and logical manner. Way the Measurement Points are organized in Work Order/Survey must reflect needs of person using instrument in the field, they should be set in logical order that reflect reality of work. Those two aspects do not necessarily align. Needs might be different. For that reason, you are able to organize your Work Orders/Surveys in different way and independently of the Tree Structure sequence. In practice, you need to consider several aspects: What Assets are located in the same area? What Assets operate at the same time? What is the best sequence of data collection, regarding ability to approach Asset? What are the competences and clearances of field technician (electrician? mechanic? process?) What Assets require data collection at the same or similar interval? How much time will it take to execute a Work Order/Survey (do not make it a big, boring job, multiple smaller tasks are more likely to get done properly) Best practice is to consult field team and understand what the safest, most comfortable, and most efficient way is to collect data in the field. As person generating Work Orders/Surveys , you should create one, walk it yourself, consult others, adjust it, and only then consider it final. Items can be added to Work Order/Survey in several ways. Add items from the Tree Structure (using mouse right click or Top toolbar commands) o You can add single measurement o You can add any tree node and it will contain all child nodes Add items from the Bottom Pane o Select items and add them o Filter items based on certain criteria and add them Add items from To-Do List o Search items by their data collection due date and add them Here is how to do it: 10.9.1. Add entire Tree Structure to Work Order/Survey \u00b6 Right click on 1st level of Tree Structure, Database root** and select Add to Work Order/Survey , choose instrument you work with, and choose if you want to add items to New Work Order/Survey or to * Add to Existing . * Work Order/Survey** window will pop up where you need to assign * Work Order/Survey Name . * Use name that is intuitive and can be easily understood by everyone. Once name is assigned, press Save . Your Work Order/Survey is generated. It is placed in Top Pane, in Work Orders/Surveys tab. 10.9.2. Add certain Nodes from Tree Structure to Work Order/Survey \u00b6 Right click on the Node you want to add and select Add to Work Order/Survey , choose instrument you work with, and choose if you want to add Node to New Work Order/Survey or to Add to Existing . Work Order/Survey** window will pop up where you need to assign * Work Order/Survey Name . * Use name that is intuitive and can be easily understood by everyone. Once name is assigned, press Save . This new Work Order/Survey is added to list of Work Orders/Surveys : You can do the same with any portion or single item from your Tree Structure. However, if you try to add and item to existing Work Order/Survey, and that item already exists there, UAS3 will warn you that item will be duplicated and ask for confirmation. 10.9.3. Add items from Bottom Pane to Work Order/Survey \u00b6 Bottom Pane displays all measurements contained in Tree node you selected: From Bottom Pane you can select any measurement (left click on the measurement), selecting Work Orders/Surveys in the Toolbox and add it to new Work Order/Survey or to existing one, as below: Instead of selecting items individually, you can Filter them by certain criteria and add them as a group. Select Selection in the Toolbox, select Filter, and small Filter window will appear at the bottom of Bottom Pane, as below: Use Filter window to enter criteria. As you enter one criterion, list will be narrowed to all items containing criteria (word) you entered. Use \u201c;\u201d to add more criteria and narrow your search further. Once you are done with filtering, you can select from the list in Bottom Pane, and add it to Work Order/Survey. To select multiple items, use \u201cshift\u201d or \u201cctrl\u201d. 10.9.4. Add items from To Do List to Work Order/Survey \u00b6 To Do List contains items based on data collection due date (based on interval you defined in settings). Due date consideration for each item starts with first data collection. In Top Pane , select Work Orders/Surveys tab and Work Order/Survey button will appear in Top toolbar instead of Tree Nodes . Left click on Work Order/Survey in Top toolbar and left click on To Do . To Do window will appear, where you can select period or two additional criteria; Missed measurements and Never measured points. Once criteria are selected, all items that meat criteria will appear. Due date is quite clear criteria, and it filters data collection scheduled in period you choose, according to their set interval (consider that interval starts the count once first ever measurement has been taken). Missed measurement is very useful criteria, as it will filter out all data collection tasks with past due date (as those do not fall into previously mentioned criteria). Never measured points criteria filters out all measurement points with no data (newly introduced to database, newly installed assets ...) reminding you that it needs to be done. From this window, you can select filtered points (single or multiple select) and with right click add them to new or existing Work Order/Survey . 10.9.5. Change Measurement order in Work Order/Survey \u00b6 You can re-order the sequence of data collection and grouping Measurements into an order which is more efficient from a data collection point of view simply by selecting a Measurement and while holding the left mouse button, dragging it to a new position and then release the left mouse button. This does not affect the Tree Structure in any way and how the data is stored in the database, it just makes it easier for you to collect it.","title":"10 creating editing tree structure"},{"location":"UAS/User%20Manual/10-creating-editing-tree-structure/#10_creating_and_editing_tree_structure","text":"As mentioned before, building a tree structure is like laying a foundation: If done correctly, all further actions will be much easier. Decide about Tree Structure logic and take following in consideration: What assets are connected by process? What assets are connected by location? What assets belong to same type, or same manufacturer? What assets are redundancy? There are many criteria, but target is always the same: Your data needs to be organized in a way that reflects reality. Tree structure needs to offer easy overview, filtering, and conclusion to one who uses it, as well as clean and straightforward work order/survey for one collecting data/inspecting. Take good care about names: lower case, upper case, space ... makes a difference. Nomenclature needs to be decided, and whatever the decision is, all involved need to follow it.

Left click on Sample Rate window arrow for drop down menu and select needed Sample Rate . You can choose between 32.000, 128.000, and 256.000 samples per second for contact sensors while Sampling rate for airborne sensors is fixed at 32.000 samples per second. Filter Frequency Setting for Ultrasound sensors is fixed at displayed frequency band. Category Name is non-editable field. Interval defines how often data needs to be collected, and it is a mandatory field. It will help you organize your surveys/work orders better by being able what tasks need to be done in coming period. Interval definition is product of your understanding of the asset and needs to come from your Criticality Analysis, Failure Mode & Effect Analysis, DIPF Curve for certain asset and certain defects, sometimes even from Failure Rate and Root Cause Analysis. Interval too long can result in anomaly development not being detected at early stage, and interval too short will have a detrimental effect of your work optimization, spending your resources unnecessarily (in this case, manpower). Interval in UAS3 Measurement Settings can be defined in Hours, Days, Weeks , and Months . Left click on time unit window, select unit, and enter the value in Interval window. Finally, you need to define Acquisition Time . Acquisition time is duration of a single measurement, recorded reading. Acquisition Time needs to be decided based on asset operation conditions. Primary factor affecting acquisition time is rotating speed (in case of rotating assets) or process itself. In case of bearings, we would like to record at least 3-5 revolutions, preferably 5-7 revolutions. As not all Assets inspected by Ultrasound are rotating, consider process itself. Take hydraulic valve as example and consider that you need to wait for its operation as well as record the operation itself. Not that in SDT340 maximum Acquisition Time depends on Sample Rate. 32.000 samples per second - maximum Acquisition Time is 600 seconds (10 minutes) 128.000 samples per second - maximum Acquisition Time is 150 seconds (2 minutes and 30s) 256.000 samples per second - maximum Acquisition Time is 75 seconds (1 minute and 15s) In case we choose Vibration sensor, Accelerometer , some details will be different.

Considering Interval , all mentioned before applies. Of course, Interval for all different measurements taken on one Asset should be the same, for practical reason. If they differ as outcome of analysis, shortest Interval should be the choice. In regard to Emissivity , you can look up in publicly available material about Emissivity for each surface material or look up for procedure to measure it yourself. However, for comparison and trending purposes, leaving Emissivity at value 1 would not be a mistake, but consider that temperature value in your reading is not exact. You can also add RPM sensor, in case of you only need to define Interval. To execute the measurement, you will need to place reflective tape, so please refer to SDT340 manual.

Measurement Settings for SDT340"},{"location":"UAS/User%20Manual/10-creating-editing-tree-structure/#1032_measurement_settings_for_sdt270","text":"When building Tree Structure for SDT270 and LUBExpert, there is a small difference; instead of Asset, Measurement Point and Measurement Settings, you will see Tree Node and Measurement Settings. In case of previously added Motor NdE bearing in Fan 1 , we would like to define several different measurements that need to be collected regularly. Create Measurement Settings window that pops up will look like this: First, choose a sensor. In Sensor Name window, press arrow for drop down menu. Only sensors you selected in System Settings will be displayed. Select needed sensor and continue with settings. In this case, we will choose Ultrasound sensor . Sample Rate in SDT270 is fixed for all sensors, so you will not be setting it as a measurement parameter. However, there is additional settings that needs to be done in SDT270 and LUBExpert that is not needed in SDT340. Setting Dynamic or/and Static measurement mode. When using SDT270 with Dynamic measurement feature, you need both Dynamic and Static settings in your Measurement Point (Tree Node). In case Static point is not defined it will be auto created with first measurement (if measurement is performed in Survey Mode, through Work Order). Measurement Name will be generated, containing Sensor name, Measurement Mode (ST or DY, Static or Dynamic) and it will contain Ht or Rw (Heterodyned for Ultrasound and Raw for Vibration). Interval defines how often data needs to be collected, and it is a mandatory field. It will help you organize your surveys/work orders better by being able what tasks need to be done in coming period. Interval definition is product of your understanding of the asset and needs to come from your Criticality Analysis, Failure Mode & Effect Analysis, DIPF Curve for certain asset and certain defects, sometimes even from Failure Rate and Root Cause Analysis. Interval too long can result in anomaly development not being detected at early stage, and interval too short will have a detrimental effect of your work optimization, spending your resources unnecessarily (in this case, manpower). Interval in UAS3 Measurement Settings can be defined in Hours, Days, Weeks, and Months . Left click on time unit window, select unit, and enter the value in Interval window. Finally, you need to define Acquisition Time . Acquisition time is duration of a single measurement, recorded reading. Acquisition Time needs to be decided based on asset operation conditions. Primary factor affecting acquisition time is rotating speed (in case of rotating assets) or process itself. In case of bearings, we would like to record at least 3-5 revolutions, preferably 5-7 revolutions. As not all Assets inspected by Ultrasound are rotating, consider process itself. Take hydraulic valve as example and consider that you need to wait for its operation as well as record the operation itself. Note that in SDT340 maximum Acquisition Time for SDT270 is 80 seconds. Now, if you prepared setting for Dynamic readings, add new settings with all equal parameters except Measurement Mode \u2013 choose Static. Or vice-versa. Your settings will look like this: In case we choose Vibration sensor, Accelerometer, some details will be different. Choose the sensor, in this case Acc1 . Sample Rate in SDT270 is fixed, so there will be no settings displayed. Filter Frequency Setting for Vibration sensor in SDT270 can be adjusted in two ranges: 10 \u2013 1000 Hz 10 \u2013 10000 Hz Once Dynamic or Static mode is selected (same approach as with Ultrasonic sensors), Measurement Name will reflect your Frequency range settings, therefore considering different Frequency range practically as a different sensor, displaying it separately in Measurement Point . Interval and Acquisition Time are set equally as in Ultrasonic sensor. If Temperature Sensor is selected, Interval and Emissivity need to be defined. Considering Interval , all mentioned before applies. Of course, Interval for all different measurements taken on one Asset should be the same, for practical reason. If they differ as outcome of analysis, shortest Interval should be the choice. In regard to Emissivity , you can look up in publicly available material about Emissivity for each surface material or look up for procedure to measure it yourself. However, for comparison and trending purposes, leaving Emissivity at value 1 would not be a mistake, but consider that temperature value in your reading is not exact. You can also add RPM sensor, in case of you only need to define Interval. To execute the measurement, you will need to place reflective tape, so please refer to SDT340 manual.

The other sensors are still visible but inactive. Choose LUBEsense to create an ultrasound measurement node and TEMP2 to create a temperature measurement node as required. For ultrasound measurements, UAS2 gives you the option to choose either Static or Dynamic and for temperature measurements you can set the measurement interval and the emissivity. The LUBExpert instrument in standard version does not measure Dynamic data, but LUBExpert Dynamic does. In case you operate with LUBExpert standard, choose Static measurement settings, otherwise your instrument will not recognize Dynamic settings. LUBExpert Dynamic will accept Dynamic measurement settings and collect Dynamic data during grease replenishment process. Same happens if you are using an SDT270DU with the LUBExpert App installed, choosing Dynamic here will instruct your SDT270DU to collect both Dynamic and Static data simultaneously. Setting the interval of data collection For both LUBEsense and TEMP2 measurements, the choice to set your preferred data collection interval time \u2776 in months, weeks, days, or hours \u2777 is made here. Note that this field is not intended to be the re-greasing interval. This field is your data collection interval. Condition assessment based on measured ultrasound data will be the trigger to perform grease replenishment (or not) as well as the quantity of grease required to restore an optimal lubrication mechanism to the bearing.

Managing Alarms \u00b6 Alarms are highly important aspect of Condition Monitoring, Condition Based Lubrication, and virtually any kind of measurement that needs to be compared with previous condition or any reference value. Alarms make managing database, decisions, and tasks much easier, and in some cases, they determine the field work. UAS3 offers excellent alarm system, covering all your needs, and still easy to work with. Alarms thresholds should be set based on data, understanding assets behavior and condition. This is a topic of our training, so feel free to contact us. As an introduction, let us start with basic rules , instructions: If working with SDT270 or LUBExpert database, Alarms can only be attached to Static measurement, as there are both Dynamic and Static If working with SDT340 database, Alarms can be attached Measurement, as there is no difference between Dynamic and Static, it is unique measurement point Types of Alarms: Absolute o Absolute Alarm monitors measurement value and compares it with defined alarm thresholds, triggers if measured value exceeds thresholds Safe o Safe Alarm monitors measurement value and checking if it is within defined range, where lower and upper threshold is defined Relative o Relative alarm monitors relationship of the measured value with first measurement, previous measurement, or referent measurement, whether increasing or decreasing Alarms monitor indicators: RMS maxRMS Peak Crest Factor Alarms differ by way they are created and managed Alarms in Template o This is where you create your alarms to use them frequently, on many assets. Consider it as \u201calarm bank\u201d. You create alarm, save it, and apply it when and where you need it Node Alarms o Locally created alarm (in the measurement itself). It is not saved in the \u201calarm bank\u201d, it is considered custom. If needed, it can be transformed to template alarm 11.1.

You can delete them, update them (change the settings), or create new. First, let us create New Alarm . Left click on New Alarm (at the bottom of Alarm List window) \u2776 Choose sensor that alarm will be applied to - Each defined alarm is defined for one sensor \u2777 Choose sampling rate (in case of SDT340) - Different sampling rates define measurements as different, even if sensor type is the same \u2778 Choose Alarm Name - Choose intuitive name. Soon you might have lots of alarms here, and it is important to be able to differentiate them easily \u2779 Choose indicator to be monitored - Each alarm monitors one indicator. To monitor other indicator as well, create additional alarm \u2776 \u00b6 \u2777 \u00b6 \u2778 \u00b6 \u2779 \u00b6 \u277a Here we decided to create and alarm for RS2T sensor, for the measurement of 32.000 samples per second, we gave it a name \u201cFan motor NdE RMS\u201d (as we need it for that position), and this alarm will monitor RMS value. Now we can define Alarm\u2019s thresholds, starting with Absolute Mode, as below: \u277b Left click on Absolute Mode On checkbox to activate this alarm Mode. \u277c Enter alarm threshold values for Alert, Warning and Danger.

Assigning Alarm from Template to single measurement \u00b6 Alarm from Template can be assigned to single measurement in several ways, but directly by selecting a measurement in Tree Structure is certainly most simple and straightforward. To do that, right click on measurement (in case you are working with SDT270 or LUBExpert, choose Static measurement) and select Set Alarm from Template : And Attach Alarm window will pop up: UAS3 automatically filters available Alarms for the sensor in the measurement you selected, making search much faster and easier. All you need to do now is browse through alarm using left and right arrows in Alarm Name field and look for the alarm you created for this measurement point. Once you find right alarm, simply click Attach. Alarm is attached and you can proceed attaching other alarms if needed. 11.3. Assigning Alarm from Template to multiple measurements............................................................................ \u00b6 Alarm from Template can be assigned to multiple measurements from the Bottom Pane. To do that, select the node in your Tree Structure that contains all that you want to find and add alarm to. Left click on that node and look at the Bottom Pane. I selected Database Root, 1st level, and all measurement it contains are now displayed in Bottom Pane. All 291 of them, as you can see right above the traffic lights. Next thing you need to do is to filter measurements you are interested in. Let us say that you want all NdE bearings on all electrical motors on fans, measured with RS2T sensor at 32.000 samples per second, in Process 1.

All tools displayed Click on arrow at the bottom to hide or show tools 13.2.3. Toolbox - Selection \u2013 Parameters \u00b6 As mentioned, if measurement (sensor level) is selected, Bottom Pane contains reading data. Exact data to be displayed can be customized by selecting Selection in Bottom Pane toolbar, then selecting Parameters. Measurement Parameters window will pop up. First tab, Measurement s , enables you to define measurements you want to see: All Available Measurements - all measurements will be displayed, entire history Most Recent - allows you to enter how many most recent measurements should be displayed Measurement Between \u2013 allows you to set date range to display measurements Measurements From \u2013 allows you to select event and display measurements only after that event Second tab, Columns , enables you to define data to be displayed in Bottom Pane. It is slightly different for SDT340, SDT270 and LUBExpert, so both will be explained. 13.2.4. SDT 340 Measurement Parameters/Columns \u00b6 You can decide what to display different data for each sensor. Select sensor (RPM, Temperature, Ultrasound, Vibration) and check all data you want to display in bottom pane. It is a matter of practicality and personal affinity, some users want to see all, some want to see only certain items. 13.2.5. SDT 270 Measurement Parameters/Columns \u00b6 Since measurements in SDT270 and LUBExpert are separate for Dynamic and Static mode, same applies for Columns. In both Static and Dynamic columns settings, select sensor and after that check all data you want displayed. What you see on screen as checked is just a personal affinity, you should customize it any way you find most suitable. Third tab, Measurements Nodes, enables you to select measurement nodes, sensors, for which measurement data you want to be displayed. 13.2.6. Toolbox - Selection \u2013 Filter \u00b6 Filter function was explained before, in section about creating a Work Order/Survey, as well as in Alarm section. Filter serves a purpose to search group of items based on certain criteria. Left click on filter and filter bar will appear at the bottom of Bottom Pane, as below: Enter criteria separated by \u201c;\u201d and no spacing. All items displayed in Bottom Pane will be filtered based on criteria. You can select them individually or multiple (use shift or ctrl) and you can apply other tools on selected group. 13.2.7. Toolbox \u2013 Alarms \u00b6 As already explained in section about alarms, Bottom Pane toolbox contains tools and functionalities to apply alarms on multiple items. Please refer to Managing Alarms section, where functionalities are explained in detail. 13.2.8. Toolbox \u2013 Work Orders/Surveys \u00b6 Please refer to Add items from Bottom Pane to Work Order/Survey section. 13.2.9. Toolbox \u2013 Interval \u00b6 As explained previously, setting interval is both mandatory and very useful, enabling numerous other functions as well as making work much easier and better organized. While Interval is set in each measurement point settings individually, in Bottom Pane it can be done both for individual and multiple measurements. Select items in Bottom Pane you want to apply action to (using Filter or manually), left click on Interval in Bottom Pane toolbox and left click on Set Interval tool. Measurement Interval window will pop up, to set interval. Enter time unit, enter intended interval, and click on Set Interval . Interval is now changed in all selected measurements. This is very useful function, and it becomes very handy in situations when data shows possible problem or deterioration on some assets, when first action needs to be to shorten the interval. 13.2.10. Edit, Delete, Exclude from Trend and setting measurement as reference \u00b6 There are additional actions that can be taken in measurement itself: Edit - opens measurement details to be overviewed Mark as Reference \u2013 sets measurement as reference, to be used in Relative Alarm settings Unmark as Reference \u2013 cancels the reference setting Delete \u2013 select reading and use \u201cdelete\u201d on you keyboard Colored highlight \u2013 warns you that highlighted measurement has different acquisition time than one in current settings Exclude from Static Trend Graph \u2013 this allows you to hide measurement from the graph and it is particularly useful to hide measurement with different acquisition time and have a consistent trend Left click on measurement to select it, then right click to open available functions. When Edit is selected, window with additional measurement information will pop up, as below: This window offers some additional information about measurement (amplification, mixer frequency, filter, calibration data ...) When Mark as Reference is selected, measurement will be marked with no further dialog. When Unmark as Reference is selected, measurement will be unmarked with no further dialog. To Delete measurement, left click to select the measurement and press Delete on your PC keyboard and confirmation will be required. All measurements with different acquisition time than one set in current settings will be highlighted so you can easily spot them. If necessary, measurements can be hidden in Static Trend Graph (not deleted). For consistency of the trend, excluding measurements with significantly different acquisition time is a good thing to do. Note that those measurements are not there as a mistake; In certain suspicious situations it is a good practice to collect longer acquisition time data. To exclude measurement from Static Trend Graph, select the measurement, right click on it and select \u201cExclude from Static Trend Graph.\u201d Measurement will be hidden from Static Trend Graph and it will be displayed differently. At any moment, you can include measurement back to Static Trend Graph following same process.","title":"13 data overview analysis"},{"location":"UAS/User%20Manual/13-data-overview-analysis/#13_data_overview_and_analysis_-_top_graph_and_bottom_pane","text":"Once collected data is downloaded to UAS3, it should be overviewed, alarms acknowledged, analysis done if needed \u2013 data should be used for what their purpose is: better understanding of asset\u2019s condition and extracting actionable conclusions from collected data.

Database definition \u00b6 UAS3 is fundamentally used as a Database to manage your collection, processing, and analysis of data. A database is an integrated collection of logically related records or files consolidated into a common pool that provides data for one or more multiple uses. It is used to store and organize information in such a way as to make it easy to retrieve. Imagine a library where you know all the books you need are located but you have no logical way of finding them \u2013 it would be a nightmare. In the same way, many databases are created in such a way that only their creator knows how to find information. As predictive maintenance departments are typically comprised of team members relying on integrated data, this would not be a good database. 5.2. Tree structure definition \u00b6 UAS3 uses hierarchical database model in which the data is organized into a tree like structure. The content could be data collected with the SDT340, SDT270 or LUBExpert, comments, events, statuses, or external document. The tree structure is the way of representing the hierarchical nature of the Database. It is named a tree structure because the representation looks like a tree. In this type of structure, The Database name, also called the Database root, is the top of the tree structure and the Measurements, also called the ''leaves\", are at the end. A Measurement is the combination between a sensor choice and Measurement settings. The branches between the Database name and the Measurements Categories are called Nodes. (^) \u2776 Database Root \u2777 Node \u2778 Measurement 5.2.1. Node \u00b6 Node is a position in a tree between the database root and the Measurement. Each node has a unique parent (their upper level) and can have multiple child (their lower levels). UAS3 database can effectively contain a virtually unlimited number of nodes, regarding your computer storage capacity. 5.2.2. Measurement \u00b6 The Measurement combines a sensor choice (by example the Needle RS1 or Parabolic dish) and a set of specific parameters (by example Static or Dynamic measurement, the Mixer Frequency, the bandwidth). For each measurement point, you can decide the type of sensor you want to use. SDT340, SDT work with a variety of different sensors like Airborne and Structure borne Ultrasound probes, Accelerometer, Tachometer, Thermometer. LUBExpert works with one single sensor \u2013 LUBESense1. \u2776 \u00b6 \u2777 \u00b6 (^) \u2778 However, the notion of sensor type is not sufficient for reliable comparison of data. For example, an RMS calculated between 10 and 1000 Hz is not comparable to an RMS calculated between 10 and 10000 Hz. This is the reason why, UAS3 adds, to the sensor type, the parameters associated to the measurement. Measurement is the end leave of the tree structure. Consequently, no sub level can be assigned to a Measurement. The Measurement name is generated automatically by UAS3, when it is created, regarding your selection. Measurements can be Static or Dynamic . Static measurement A static measurement is one which is purely a single numerical value - a dB\u03bcV value (RMS, maxRMS or Peak), linear value of ratio (Crest Factor), RMS velocity, Peak acceleration ... or a temperature are all static measurements. Static measurements can be collected using either the SDT340, SDT270 or LUBExpert. These values are normally logged for trending or alarm comparison. Dynamic measurement A dynamic measurement is entire event recorded during defined data acquisition time, represented as Time domain or Frequency domain. An example of dynamic measurement would be a recording of the ultrasonic signal from a bearing, or a recording of the collection of close and purge phases of a steam trap. This type of measurement would normally be analyzed by viewing and processing the time signal of perhaps the spectrum of the signal in UAS3. 5.3. Structure of a good database \u00b6 A considerable amount of thought should go into the structure of your database. Spending some time in detailed consideration of nomenclature and organizational structure, will help you to develop your database in the right way today. NOTE! \u00b6 It is highly recommended to introduce several assets into your database, and work with it for day or two, in different situations, performing different tasks. If you are not completely satisfied, edit it, try it again. Once you are satisfied and tree structure is correctly reflecting organizational structure and it is suitable for required tasks, continue. Do not put yourself in a position of introducing 1000 assets and realizing then that it should be organized differently. It may be that you have already been through this process with the development of your computerized maintenance management software (CMMS) database in which case you are likely to be using the same database structure in UAS3. If you are not familiar to this topic, here are some issues to consider. Consider when you are filling in an address form. There can be several levels of information needed to define your address: Country. State, Province or Region Town or City name District name Street or road name House or Apartment number The database required to manage all this data would require 6 levels in order to fully describe the location of each house or apartment. Notice how the structure starts at the top, with the country, and moves down becoming more specific, or localized, with each lower level. Consider how you might want to organize and search through this database to: Find a particular house on a particular street. Find all houses on that street Find all the streets in a particular district with the same name An important function of the database then, is to organize the data into a hierarchical structure \u2013 this is what we call a tree. Using UAS3, you can create multiple databases. Each database is characterized by its name and has its own tree structure. In a tree structure model, the database name is equivalent to the database root. The number of databases is limited only by your computer storage capacity. You cannot open simultaneously several databases. One logical unit (process, location...) should be in one database/tree structure. You can upload only one database at the time in the SDT340, SDT270 or LUBExpert. This is additional reason to create your database with logical nature of work in mind. 5.4. Number of levels \u00b6 Inside UAS3 databases, you can organize the tree with a maximum of 6 levels. This means, 6 additional levels below your tree structure name. Final level (whether it is 2nd, 3rd, ... or 6th) allows you to define a measurement (sensor type, measurement settings). This is just to avoid confusion that might appear when counting levels (it could look like 8 if includes tree structure name and sensor/measurement level). This should be more than enough for most applications and will generally be more than is used by your CMMS program. Careful consideration should be given to the use of these levels to maximize your ability to locate and describe a measurement point within your plant. Tree structure is there to make you do your job easily, so it needs to be built in a way that allows you to search, filter or view asset groups and assets in easiest way. Whilst we have 6 levels, you do not need to use all 6 all of the time. If you can define your measurement point location at 2nd, 3rd or 4th level, that is all you need to create. There is no requirement to invent levels just to make it up to 6. UAS3 is flexible enough to identify measurements wherever they may be in the tree structure which gives you tremendous flexibility in your database design. The SDT270 and LUBExpert Database is identical to that of UAS3, but its screen can display only 5 levels at the time. SDT340 will display all levels defined in UAS3. 5.5. Choice of a reliable naming \u00b6 In UAS3 database, as in most databases, the use of upper, lower case and space character can be used as a distinguishing characteristic which can be used to filter through large amounts of data quickly: Pump 1 is not the same as pump1. Pump1 is not the same as pump 1. Non-driven bearing is not the same as Nd bearing or/and bearing. Being consistent is critically important when you are creating a database. It helps you to keep track and it helps the database search engine to find what you are looking for in future. It is important that you develop a standardized naming system and stick to it. Think of terms you can use within your own plant or organization which will convey meaning. Abbreviation is often required, so make sure that the abbreviations you use are consistent and understood by all involved. Consistency between the maintenance department and operators is also important. If you have a conveyor feed into a zoned oven for example, do you number the Recirc fans from the infeed end forward or from the outfeed end backwards? Is your system consistent with what the operators call them? One simple naming system is to use capitals for Areas, Processes, Functions (Recirc Fan, Boiler Feed Water Pump) and lower-case letters for components inside one of these functional units (motor, pump, fan, gearbox, bearing). You might want to add a suffix that might help you easily filter assets according to certain criteria (as an example; electrical motor GL, where GL stands for Grease Lubricated, or exhaust fan OL, where OL stands for Oil Lubricated) and extract only assets that you need for certain task. 5.6. Considerations for Database construction \u00b6 As you add more and more information, data, and measurements to any predictive maintenance database, the value and the cost of the database increases. That value is based upon the knowledge locked away inside it about the reliability of components, systems and methods used in your plant. Cost related to database represents hundreds of ours invested to populate it. Both value and cost are high, so make sure you built it in a way that will deliver benefit. As you build your database then, plan ahead a little bit by putting information in now which will make it easy for you to do some digging in the future. Consider some of these real-life database searches and their implications in the database construction. In example, show me: Bearings mounted next to belt pulleys. Drive end bearing of all 15kW motors on site. Pump drive end bearing. Conveyor roll bearings using ABC grease. One way to build an efficient database is to: Regroup all identical equipment into one branch level (or Node). Regroup equipment from a process function into one branch level. Avoid regrouping machines regarding survey routines.","title":"5 introduction to database"},{"location":"UAS/User%20Manual/5-introduction-to-database/#5_introduction_to_database_tree_structure","text":"","title":"5.
