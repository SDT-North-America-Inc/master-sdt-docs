By default, the TWave T8 (and the Vigilant) is supplied with the following IP address: 192.168.0.150.  (Factory/Default IP)

When it is supplied along with the Mobility Case the unit is set by us with the IP address 10.8.2.150 (this is not Factory IP)  


 My advice is to try the following:

1. Connecting the Vigilant unit directly to the local network
2. Install this software on your computer:
