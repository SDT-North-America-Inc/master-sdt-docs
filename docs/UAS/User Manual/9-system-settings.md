# 9. System settings & System images

In **System Settings** menu, you will define certain settings that will make your work easier (not
mandatory), but you will also need to introduce certain data that mandatory for work continuation.

In top toolbar, click **Options** and then **System settings** :

Settings management window will pop up.

By selecting first tab – **General** – you can choose **Tree Structure Icon** and **Navigation Pin Icon** for any
of the **Tree Structures** withing the **Data Folder** you currently use.
Click **Browse** , and select **Icon** from **System Images** (it will be later explained how to upload additional
icons):

By selecting next tab – **Domain Graphs** – you can select **Fast Preview** for your **Time Domain****_._**
By selecting this option, Ultrasound signal displayed in **Time Domain** will be down sampled for fast
loading, but at any moment, you can load full data by single click while viewing **Time Domain**.

In the same tab, you can adjust settings for FFT, both **Number of Samples** and **Window Function****_._**


Next tab – **Units** – allows you to set unit for Temperature, Acceleration, Velocity, Grease weight,
Frequency and Bearing size.

Next tab – **Printer** – allows you to define paper size for printout:

Next tab – **Sensors** – enables you to customize list of sensors you use. Full list of sensors contains all
sensors in SDT produce range, but you do not necessarily use all of them. In order to narrow the list
offered to you while choosing the sensor, select sensors you have and only those sensors will be in
the list. Additionally, if you use UAS3 to work with LUBExpert, select **LUBExpert Mode** and only
LUBEsense1 and TEMP2 will be shown.

Next tab – **Connection** – In case you need to configure a Proxy Server, due to your company
restriction, to connect to internet, fill the necessary information here:


Next tab – **Tree View** – contains setting for Tree Structure appearance in top pane, the way levels will
be visually connected. Settings also contain a choice for preferred Dashboard type in case you are
using LUBExpert alongside other instruments or SDT270 with LUBExpert features. Since LUBEsense1
(sensor used by LUBExpert) results are displayed with specific graphs, and it is possible that within
one node you might have multiple sensors or both Lubrication and Condition Monitoring results, you
may choose the preferred dashboard to be displayed when you select Measurement Point, for fast
data preview. Once you select sensor within that Measurement Point, specific dashboard of that
sensor will be displayed.

Next tab – **Lubricants** – is a database of your Lubricants. For use of LUBExpert, populating this
database is mandatory, as each Lubrication point must have Lubricant type assigned.
Add Lubricant name in highlighted window (up to 12 characters) and click **Add****_._**

If you need to edit lubricant name, select Lubricant in the list, edit name in highlighted field and click
on **Edit**. If you want to delete Lubricant, select it, and click on Delete. You can arrange how Lubricants
appear in the list by selecting Lubricant and **Move up** and **Move down** buttons. Once you completed,
click on **Save and close**.


Last tab – **Grease guns** – is a database containing your Grease guns. Same as with Lubricants, if you
are using LUBExpert or SDT270 with LUBExpert features, it is mandatory to populate this database, as
each Lubrication point needs to have Grease gun assigned. Type Grease gun name (up to 5
characters) in **Grease gun ID** window, enter **Amount of grease per stroke** value (mandatory) and
click on **Add**. To edit, select Grease gun from the list, change data and click on **Save changes**. Once
finished, click on **Save and close**.
You can find more details about LUBExpert features and functions in dedicated LUBExpert manual,
embedded in your UAS3.

**Node Icons** (later explained in node setting), can be uploaded and managed in through **System
images** feature. **Click on Utilities, System Images, Node Icons**.

Window will pop up where you can view existing **Node Icons** or upload new ones.
